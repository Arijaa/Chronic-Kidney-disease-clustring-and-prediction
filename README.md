# 🩺💡 Chronic Kidney Disease: Clustering & Prediction

Welcome to our exciting journey into the realm of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) analysis and prediction! 🎉 Get ready for some data-driven adventures in healthcare! 🚀

## What's Inside? 📦

This project is your ticket to a world of data magic! Here's what you'll find:

1. **Pre-processing**: Let's tidy up that data! We'll be fixing typos, filling in missing values, and getting everything spick and span! 🧹✨

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Time to put on our detective hats! We'll be uncovering hidden insights, plotting graphs, and maybe even stumbling upon some surprising discoveries! 🔍📊

3. **Prediction & Cluster Analysis**: Brace yourself for some serious data crunching! We'll be comparing models, training neural networks, and maybe even finding some clusters of CKD patients along the way! 💡🧠

## Models 🤖

We have implemented and compared multiple machine learning models for kidney disease classification, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

The models are trained and evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to ensure their performance.
